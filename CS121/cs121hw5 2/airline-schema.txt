Write the relational model schema for your airline database in this file, using
the notation we have used all term.  You can indicate primary key columns by
enclosing the attribute names in _ characters.  Include descriptions of other
candidate keys or foreign keys (if any) immediately under each relation schema.
Example:

foo(_a_, b, c)
 * b is also a candidate key
 * c is a foreign key to bar.c
